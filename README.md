# snake-game-in-python
The classic snake game, in Python. Get it?

Based on a tutorial by [Clear Code](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Snake). I used dictionaries with tuple-keys instead of additional methods on the Snake class to draw the images. Also added a custom menu.
This game was developed in python version 3.8.10 (pygame version 2.0.3)
To run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
